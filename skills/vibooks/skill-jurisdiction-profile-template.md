# Jurisdiction Profile Template

Use this template when adding a new country or region profile under
`skills/vibooks/`.

Keep the profile pragmatic, conservative, and tied to the current shipped
product. Do not imply first-class product support that does not yet exist.

```md
# <Country Or Region> Jurisdiction Profile

Profile id: `<profile_id>`

Status: `official` | `skill_guided` | `generic_only`

Scope: one short paragraph describing the business shape and any major limits.

## Use This Profile When

- ...

Do not choose this profile merely because ...

## Authority Order

Use these sources in order:

1. explicit Vibooks company or book setup already saved
2. real registrations, reporting obligations, and subnational footprint
3. source documents and business profile details
4. explicit user instruction
5. current device country only as a last-resort bootstrap suggestion

If the country is clear but the relevant subnational jurisdiction is still
unclear, stop and ask before creating tax master data.

## Reporting-Basis Default

Use ... only when ...

Rules:

3. ...

Do not claim that Vibooks has ... unless the shipped product actually exposes
that support.

## Chart-Of-Accounts Rules

include:

Do not create these just because they are common in the jurisdiction.

## Tax Control Accounts And Tax Codes

## Account Numbering Guidance

Account numbering is recommended, not mandatory.

- ...

Do not renumber an existing clean chart solely to fit a template.

## Units Of Measure

## Future Product Mapping

When Vibooks later ships first-class localization for this jurisdiction, keep
the same profile id and prefer the official product setup.

## Reference Points

- government tax authority or regulator:
  [...]
- accounting standards body or professional guidance:

- mainstream SMB software alignment:

```

## Authoring Rules

- bind the profile to company or book jurisdiction, not operator nationality
- keep country, reporting basis, tax registration, and industry as separate
  axes
- use official government or standards-body sources first
- use mainstream software docs only for UX alignment, not as legal authority
- prefer role-based account semantics over cosmetic display-name purity
- stop and ask whenever subnational tax differences materially change the setup
